# JobManagement

This project is designed to help disadvantaged people find a job that is right for them.
The system comes down to two types of profiles: Consumer and Business. Users can
create their digital profiles with video business cards, skills, performance and more.
And business accounts get the ability to filter and find the right employees and connect
with them through in-app personal messages. The system also has a bazaar and news.
